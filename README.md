## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS

In collaboration with the client, I worked to showcase their expertise and highlighted their skills as a product manager. The process involved close communication to understand the client's vision, resulting in a well-defined and tailored structure for the site. Prioritizing simplicity in design, I aimed to showcase the client's capabilities effectively, creating a user-friendly platform that emphasized their strengths as a product manager.

## Optimizations

Revamped the client's website to make it super smooth and user-friendly. It has a responsive design, making sure it looks slick on any device. Did some work on the images, resizing and reformatting for faster loading. And you bet I ran some Google speed tests to fine-tune everything. ðŸš€ 

## Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot about delivering what the customer wants. I would taken more time to go through and make the site in sections. I would make sure each section is fully responsive and working before moving on. That way I can reuse sections like legos.
